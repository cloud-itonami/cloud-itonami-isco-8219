# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's line coverage and crew intake process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for assembler/line records.
3. Run synthetic operating cases (work-log entry, crew-operation
   scheduling, supply coordination, safety-concern flagging).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical`
   actions (all flagged safety concerns, above-threshold supply
   orders).
5. Measure operating outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (pinch-point/crush hazard, hand-tool
  injury, equipment condition)
- provenance for all operating records (assembler and line both
  independently registered)
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions
- a hard, unconditional block on any attempt to route an
  assembly-execution decision, a line-safety-clearance decision, or a
  plant-safety-officer-override decision, through this actor — those
  decisions stay the plant safety officer's exclusive authority end to
  end

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans, and that no deployment configuration can route an
assembly-execution decision, a line-safety-clearance decision, or a
plant-safety-officer judgment override through this actor.
