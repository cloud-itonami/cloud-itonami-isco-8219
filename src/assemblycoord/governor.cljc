(ns assemblycoord.governor
  "AssemblyCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating
  every line scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may make for a
  generic assembly-line crew (ISCO-08 8219, Assemblers Not Elsewhere
  Classified — a residual category covering diverse assembly-line work
  not captured by the more specific 8211/8212 unit groups). The
  governor never dispatches hardware itself, never performs assembly
  work itself, and never finalizes an assembly-execution decision
  (e.g. deciding to proceed with a specific assembly run) or a
  line-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring an assembly line
  safety cleared), and never overrides a plant safety officer's
  judgment — those are permanently out of this actor's scope and
  remain a plant safety officer's exclusive judgment (README's
  'Robotics premise': this actor coordinates LINE SCHEDULING/
  LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs assembly work itself). Modeled
  closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8122's platingcoord.governor.

  Standard assembly-line hazards apply generically here (pinch-point/
  crush hazard, hand-tool injury) without a single dominant hazard
  type, unlike the more specific electroplating-chemical hazard in
  8122 or a similarly narrow hazard in other ISCO-08 unit groups —
  `:hazard-type` on a `:flag-safety-concern` proposal is a free-form
  keyword, always escalated regardless of value.

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. assembler provenance   — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. line provenance        — the assembly line/facility must be
                                independently verified/registered
                                before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs assembly work itself;
                                it only gates what the advisor may
                                coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize an
                                assembly-execution decision (e.g.
                                deciding to proceed with a specific
                                assembly run), or a line-safety-
                                clearance decision (e.g. declaring an
                                assembly line safety cleared), or to
                                override a plant safety officer's
                                judgment, is a hard, permanent block
                                (checked both against the proposed :op
                                and, defense-in-depth, against the
                                proposal's :rationale text — matched as
                                full finalization/execution ACTION
                                phrases such as \"finalize the assembly
                                operation\" / \"declare the line safety
                                cleared\" / \"override the plant safety
                                officer's judgment\", never as bare
                                nouns like \"assembly\", \"component\"
                                or \"fixture\", so the check can never
                                self-trip on the advisor's own routine
                                rationale text, e.g. \"logged work
                                record for assembler …\" or \"scheduled
                                crew operation for assembly task …\" or
                                \"…routed for plant safety officer
                                review\" — all three legitimately
                                contain bare domain nouns but none is a
                                finalization action, and all are
                                exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a pinch-point/crush-hazard /
                                hand-tool-injury / equipment-condition
                                concern always escalates to a human,
                                never auto-commits).
    7. :op :coordinate-supply-order above `supply-cost-threshold`.
    8. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`).

  This actor coordinates LINE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  performs assembly work itself, and it never makes a line-safety-
  clearance decision itself; those decisions always route to a human
  plant safety officer, either via a hard permanent block on the
  op-allowlist (rules 4/5 above) or via a mandatory escalation (rule 6
  above)."
