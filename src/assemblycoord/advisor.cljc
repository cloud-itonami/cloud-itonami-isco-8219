(ns assemblycoord.advisor
  "Assembly Line Scheduling Coordination Advisor — proposing a line
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a work record,
  schedule a crew operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a
  components/materials-stock supply order) from a crew roster, line
  registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the
  advisor ONLY proposes — `assemblycoord.governor` independently gates
  every proposal and always escalates safety concerns and
  above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never proposes to
  directly finalize an assembly-execution decision (e.g. deciding to
  proceed with a specific assembly run), or a line-safety-clearance
  decision (e.g. declaring an assembly line safety cleared), and never
  proposes to override a plant safety officer's judgment — those stay
  permanently out of this actor's scope. Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-8122's platingcoord.advisor.

  8219 (Assemblers Not Elsewhere Classified) is a residual category
  covering diverse assembly-line work not captured by the more
  specific 8211/8212 unit groups. Standard assembly-line hazards apply
  generically (pinch-point/crush hazard, hand-tool injury) without a
  single dominant hazard type, so `:hazard-type` here is a free-form
  keyword rather than a fixed enum. This actor coordinates LINE
  SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs assembly work or makes
  safety-clearance decisions itself.
