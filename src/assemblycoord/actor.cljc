(ns assemblycoord.actor
  "AssemblyCoordActor — the ISCO-08 8219 assemblers not elsewhere
  classified line scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one line-coordination operation request
  (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-8122's platingcoord.actor.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Assembly Line Scheduling
  Coordination Advisor can never directly commit an operating record
  the AssemblyCoordGovernor refuses, and can never make this actor
  finalize an assembly-execution decision (e.g. deciding to proceed
  with a specific assembly run) or a line-safety-clearance decision
  (e.g. declaring an assembly line safety cleared), and can never
  override a plant safety officer's judgment — every commit-record!
  call is gated behind `:decide`, and that decision class is a
  permanent hard block regardless of disposition path. This actor
  coordinates LINE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs
  assembly work itself, and it never makes a line-safety-clearance
  decision itself."
