  scheduling/logistics coordination actor (itonami actor pattern,
  ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's 'Robotics
  premise' — a line scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs
  crew scheduling, production-run/inventory/progress-record logging
  and components/materials-stock supply-order coordination for a
  generic assembly-line crew under this advisor/governor pair, which
  never dispatches hardware itself, never performs assembly work
  itself, and never finalizes an assembly-execution decision or a
  line-safety-clearance decision, and never overrides a plant safety
  officer's judgment — those remain the plant safety officer's
  exclusive judgment). Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-8122's
  platingcoord.store.

  Domain:

    assembler — a registered assembly-line crew member (:assembler-id,
                :name)
    line      — a registered assembly line/facility {:line-id :name
                :max-supply-cost number}. `:max-supply-cost` is an
                informational registered ceiling used only to decide
                whether a `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal
                escalates to human sign-off (the governor never blocks
                a within-threshold order outright; it only decides
                commit vs. escalate).
    record    — a committed operating record (a logged production-run/
                inventory/progress entry, a scheduled crew/shift
                operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
                components/materials-stock supply order) — written
                ONLY via commit-record!. This actor coordinates line
                scheduling/logistics ONLY — a `record` is a
                coordination artifact, never an assembly-execution
                act, never a line-safety-clearance decision, and never
                a plant safety officer's-judgment override.
    ledger    — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.

  8219 is a residual 'Not Elsewhere Classified' ISCO-08 unit group
  covering diverse assembly-line work not captured by the more
  specific unit groups (e.g. 8211 mechanical machinery assembly, 8212
  electrical/electronic equipment assembly). Standard assembly-line
  hazards apply generically here (pinch-point/crush hazard, hand-tool
  injury) without a single dominant hazard type, so `:hazard-type` on
  a `:flag-safety-concern` proposal is a free-form keyword rather than
  a fixed enum.")
